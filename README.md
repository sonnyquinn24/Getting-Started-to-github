### Tool Calling

Tool calling refers to the process of invoking specific functions or methods within a programming or scripting context. It allows developers to execute predefined operations, which can range from manipulating data to interacting with user interfaces. The clarity in tool calling is essential for ensuring that the intended operations are executed correctly and efficiently.

For example:

```javascript
// Example of calling a function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const result = add(5, 3); // Calling the add function
console.log(result); // Output will be 8
```

This example demonstrates how a simple function can be called to perform an operation, illustrating the concept of tool calling in programming.
